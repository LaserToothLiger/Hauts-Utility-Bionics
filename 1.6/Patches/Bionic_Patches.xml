	<Operation Class="PatchOperationFindMod"><!--gastro-analyzers suck, lol, both compared to HUB noses and even if no mods are being considered. It doesn't make sense that they somehow make you cook faster, but I don't think it would be right for this mod to address that.
													Instead, let's just add a bonus that a better sense of food-related olfaction would LOGICALLY give you, the ability to detect food gone bad and therefore avoid putting it in your meals.-->

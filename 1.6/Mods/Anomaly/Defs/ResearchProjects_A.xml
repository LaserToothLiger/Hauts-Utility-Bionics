    <description>Modify archotech bionics by implanting shards into them, causing their potency to improve based on the current anomalous activity level. There may be unforseen, long-lasting consequences to this process.</description>

    <discoveredLetterTitle>About: voidshard homonculi</discoveredLetterTitle>
    <discoveredLetterText>Now that your colonists understand how to create their own voidshard bionics, they are now capable of taking apart voidshard homonculi. This surgical operation will irreversibly destroy the homunculus, but will extract some of its bionics in their original archotech forms. It will likely be dangerous.</discoveredLetterText>
